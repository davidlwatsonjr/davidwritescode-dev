<h1>Working on the next davidlwatsonjr.com</h1>

<p>This page (the index) is a work in progress.</p>
<p>It will match the page at <a href="https://davidlwatsonjr.com">davidlwatsonjr.com</a>.</p>
<p>It will also match the theme there.</p>
<p>I just need to learn more about Jekyll and how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generate an index page</li>
<li>Create pages with more user-friendly urls (without .html)</li>
<li>Create a theme</li>
<li>Create a Jekyll layout</li>
</ul>
<p>All that said, I'm also looking into moving my existing site from shared Wordpress hosting to a more complicated but cost-effective (FREE!) tech stack.</p>
<p>It's all an expirement in learning more than an attempt at cost-cutting.</p>
<p>But it's been to play around with some newer things.</p>
